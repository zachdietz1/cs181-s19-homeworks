# The code below gives a bare bones approach for getting the dendogram
# for part 3 of problem 1. You will need to write the dist functions that
# have been left blank and specify the remaining norms (either finding)
# an equivalent numpy function or writing your own function). The program
# will then output how the points merge at each step and the distance at which
# they merge.
